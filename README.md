## 👋 Hey there! I'm Max 🚀

`feat(👶): initial commit | Sept, 1993, 12:38 PM GMT+1`

I'm a _**super passionate**_ software engineer who believes in **craftsmanship** over quick fixes. I not only love learning and exploring new tech, but I also like teaching my newly found knowledge to others!

Currently, I'm into TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js, React, nx and other shiny tools that help in building awesome stuff on the web. Also, I'm always on the lookout for the next cool thing to learn and master!

When not elbow-deep in code, you'll find me 🚴‍♂️ spinning, gaming 🎮, or turning my home into a smart hub 🏡. 

If you want to see what I was up to the last year/week, have a look at those graphs 👇
